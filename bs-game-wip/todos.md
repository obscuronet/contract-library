Game  mechanics notes
-Seeing all hits/misses before playing gives teh first mover a disadvantage. Result, no one makes the first move
-not being able to see the game state until after placing a bet makes interacting with an
almost complete board a frustrating experience.
- perhaps a portion of the pool can be received after a ship is sunk
